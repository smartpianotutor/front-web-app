// Tests for:

// -3.2.3.3.1 The generated MusicXML shall be displayed as a small sheet music snippet, 3-5 measures at a time.
// -3.2.3.3.2 The user interface shall request the user to press and key to begin the practice session snippet.
// -3.2.3.3.2 Once the practice session begins, the interface shall display a bar animating on the sheet music which indicates the progression of time. In other words, when a user presses a key on their piano keyboard it will correspond to the sheet music note nearest to this moving bar.
// -3.2.3.3.2 Simultaneous to playing, the interactive practice session shall record the piano keyboard presses (note, timing, length) for later processing in the ability estimation update step.
